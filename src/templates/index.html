                    Another Euro, another occasion to pit cloudster against each
                    other for the title of the ultimate football clairvoyant!
                    Think that person is you? If so, join us in the Cloudreach
                    Euro 2016 predictions game!

                <p class="text-margin-top">The game will run two concurrent competitions:</p>

                <h4 class="text-margin-top">The sweepstake competition</h4>
                <p>
                    No skills invovolved here. Each participant will be
                    allocated one of the 24 participating countries. You win if
                    your team wins the Euros! However, there's a twist... As we
                    will likely have more than 24 cloudsters participate, you
                    might have to share your winnings with other people. The game
                    will ensure all teams have been allocated at least once before
                    making them available again for a further round of allocations.
                    Choose you moment wisely to enter the competition...
